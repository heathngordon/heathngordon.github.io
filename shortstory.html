<center> <h1>The First Story</h1> </center>
<p>Once there was a young llama named Pierre. He was a very confused llama because he did not enjoy living with other llamas, but rather enjoyed the company of a young sparrow named Tenerife.</p>
<p>Tenerife lived in a cactus, so one day, Pierre went for a visit. He found Tenerife happily eating some seeds.</p>
<p>"Tenerife," Pierre said, "I've been thinking. What would happen if I came and lived out in the desert with you? It's quite a long walk from my llama herd to your cactus, so why not make it easier for both of us?"</p>
<p>Tenerife choked on the seed he was eating. "But Pierre! What about all your brothers and sisters? Wouldn't they miss you?"</p>
<p>"No", said Pierre, "They're too busy with their own lives. Besides," he added, pawing at the ground, "I'd rather live with you anyway."</p>
<p>"But Pierre!" Tenerife squauked again, managing to swallow the seed he was choking on, "How would you feed yourself? There's nothing but cacti out in this desert!"</p>
<p>"It wouldn't be too hard to go find a grassy field every day. Besides, you could come with me to find seeds and berries."</p>
<p>"But Pierre! Where would you live?"</p>
<p>"I could just sleep outside your cactus here. Perhaps I'd keep away the predators too."</p>
<p>There was a sudden squauk from behind Tenerife, Pierre saw a tiny, fuzzy head pop up from behind his tail feathers. "Who's dat, daddu?"</p>
<p>A smile came upon Tenerife's face. "You know, Pierre, I'd let you stay, if it weren't for the fact that I already have a family."</p>
<p>But instead of being disappointed, Pierre watched the tiny sparrow as it was soon joined by two others. A rustling of feathers behind him that another sparrow was coming-a Mrs. Tenerife.</p>
<p>Tenerife explained to Mrs. Tenerife about Pierre's wish, who was utterly delighted at the idea of having a llama as a protector of their nest.</p>
<p>"Why, of <i>course</i> you can stay, Pierre! And while you're guarding, you can give us some of your wool for the little ones!"</p>
<p>And so it was decided. And from that point on, Pierre the llama kept diligent watch over the cactus and the whole family while they grew and eventually feathered to become the best of sparrows.</p>
