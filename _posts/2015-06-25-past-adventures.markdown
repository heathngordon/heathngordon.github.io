I finally bought an SD Card to USB converter, so I should be able to post my pictures on here more frequently, which is amazing, because now I don't have to upload pictures on one computer and put them on here with another. Yay for time-saving. 

Well, the past couple weeks have been filled with rain. Lots of rain, compliments of Tropical Storm Bill...

But despite the rain, the birds still managed to eat through two to three feeders a day, as well as finding shelter within.

There was one morning that I got up fairly early (6:00 am or so) in a successful attempt to avoid the rain. I grabbed my camera and spent an hour out watching the woodland activity from atop my car. Here are some of the pictures I snatched.

Raymond, our resident chipmunk. He quite enjoys bird seed. I always leave a little pile of it for him at the base of the step, where he likes to hide.

This is Tilla, one of our gray squirrels. She was obviously young, so I'm thinking she might have come from Brutus' brood, one of our other resident squirrels, mainly because of the amount of red on her.

So much for squirrel-proof feeders...

Later that week, in a break from Mr. Bill, our barred owl pair came hunting. The Carolina Wrens were quite furious with them, and spent the next half hour or so filling the air with alarm calls. Even the cardinals and blue jays, the usual watch dogs, had stopped by then. So I suppose these little guys were feeling a bit too threatened by something nearly five times its size and a mouth about as big as its whole body. Yeah, that might be a tad frightening.

The next evening, I went on a walk, looking for some birds, just scouting out more of the area.

I mentioned that I've been looking for a catbird, because I know I've been hearing them. Well, since then, I've seen at least three of them. Then, today, as I was uploading my pictures, I came across this lovely bird that I'd seen around and questionably identified it as related to a brown headed cowbird.

The only problem was that its head wasn't brown. It was a lighter gray, which put a stark contrast between its head and body. So today I uploaded it to <a href="http://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/photo-id/">Merlin</a>, a new bird identification app that Cornell has developed, to see if it could help me. And it identified it as a catbird, which now has me scratching my head, because for one, it doesn't have the characteristic black stripe on its crown. For two, the beak seems to be more like a finch's beak than a catbird's. And for three, I didn't see any "rufous patch", as <a href="http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Gray_Catbird/id">Cornell</a> states. My bird book, (National Geographic, <i>Field Guide to Birds of North America</i>, Fifth Edition), says it also has a black tail, although some of the pictures on the internet differ with that. So I'll be watching out for this bird... taking pictures whenever I can and hopefully be able to identify it soon.


As far as stories go... I've been working on the dystopia that I wrote for NaNoWriMo last year, attempting to work out characters and get the plot a little more solid and organized. I might write some of it for Camp NaNoWriMo in July. I am also working on, at the request of one of my friends, a parody of my school for the school newspaper this year. There hasn't been much progress, because I haven't sprung upon any brilliant ideas yet, but I know each person will be displayed as a different type of animal, and it will follow sort of like a mix of <i>Madagascar</i> and <i>Lost</i>. Which will be interesting to say the least. More to come on that.

I've also been volunteering at a Wild Bird Rehabilitation place twice a week for the past month or so. It's been awesome. I've been learning a lot about the different personalities of different species of songbirds, what they eat, and  other little tidbits from them. For example, I've learned how to recognize fledglings out in the wild, juveniles shifting into their mature plumage, and other things as well. My favorite so far has been a fledgling cardinal, too young to understand how to pick up waxworms. When I feed her, occasionaly waxworms fall on the bottom of her cage, and she knows nothing but to cheep at it. And so she watches it, cheeping, with her mouth open, as if she expects it to hop right in. Fledglings are by far the funniest little things.
