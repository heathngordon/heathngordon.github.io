title: Birding Basics October Edition
---

Over the past couple of months, we’ve talked about migration and bird calls… and, well, I guess that’s just about it. Funny. I thought we would’ve said more on the subject of birds. Ah well. Point is, this month, we’re focusing on what makes a bird a bird: the feathers. For the most part, it’s fairly easy to tell the difference between two birds. Right of the bat, if I asked, you could tell me the difference between a Northern Cardinal and a Blue Jay. One is bright red and one is bright blue. It doesn’t take a genius. However, if I asked you to tell me the difference between an American Crow and a Common Raven, would you be able to tell me? I’ll even give you the benefit of the doubt and say you’re Kate, and you already know that the Common Raven is bigger, and it doesn’t live in the Midwest. But unfortunately, even if you do end up going West (or North), there’s still going to be both the American Crow and the Common Raven. 

So how do you tell two birds apart that are all black and sound like a cat with a hairball? And this is the part where birding becomes more about knowing the subtle differences than simply observation. And just so we go into this with the right mindset, you must know that ravens and crows are some of the smartest birds of the bunch. 

In the air, the two birds look much the same. But if you look closely as they wheel about, there are some distinct differences. Ravens will usually be in a pair, or simply flying solo. Crows, on the other hand, tend to travel in packs (called a “murder”). According to allaboutbirds.com, ravens are quite acrobatic in the air, as well. One raven was apparently recorded to have flown upside down for more than half a mile. I don’t know about you, but that seems a little crazy. But that’s just a little glimpse of their personality. As far as feather structure, which is what we really should be focusing on, if you count the extended feathers on wings, ravens will have six, while crows will have only five. Ravens’ tails will also appear diamond-shaped, while crows have a more stocky rectangular shape. 

But say one of them is up close, and you don’t have a crow or raven to compare: how can you tell then? The first test is to see if they’re in a murder or with only one or two other birds. A murder means crow. One or two means a raven. The second test is to look at its beak: does it seem to have a lot of hair-like feathers covering the beak? If it does, then it’s a raven. If it doesn’t, it’s a crow. Third test, if you’re still unsure, is to look at the neck. Most ravens are going to have a lot more fluffy neck feathers than crows. The fourth, and final test, of course, is to utilize that skill that you learned last month: to know birds by their calls. Although not strictly “songbirds”, knowing these different calls can prove exceedingly helpful when you’re in the field. Ravens are going to produce more of a low, raspy, croaking sound, perhaps akin to, well… a sick toad? Really, compared to a crow, you can hear the individual note change, like gears turning. A crow has a smoother and less rambunctious call. However, as I said before, ravens and crows have been found to be some of the smartest birds in the ornithology world. (The Huffington Post reports that the Common Raven is the cleverest animal next to a human.) 

What does that mean exactly? It means that these birds have been known to mimic other birds’ calls, plus add to their own repertoires of no less than 20 calls each, and even going to the point of mimicking human speech in captivity. Which means that next time someone calls you a bird-brain, you can say thank you, because they just paid you a compliment.
