While there weren't too terribly many that I caught on photo, I have to give them credit for being so ridiculously amazing. Talk about the colors!

A very spiky caterpillar, which we were instructed very sternly not to touch. There were also quite a few colorful bugs up in the mountains that I didn't get pictures of, but when I asked what they were, we were told that many of the bugs didn't even have names because there were so many different varieties. So, if you're looking to name a bug after yourself... just go to the mountains of Costa Rica. There's enough for everyone.

Packs of wild dogs roamed everywhere, although I think this was the biggest pack we saw. There were a few more dogs roaming up the street together.

The moths and flies were fairly docile and slow. So slow that you could squish them just by shifting your foot, which would send a fly here, in the US, buzzing off. I'd be interested to figure out why their reactions were so slow. Perhaps because speed is not their first defense, but rather coloring? Bugs, for me, are in and entirely different realm.

And of course there were monkeys...

And baby boa constrictors...

And the most colorful butterflies you ever did see.

After the butterflies, we went to the great cats, most of which were asleep or too tired to move.

Those eyes...

Jaguars.

Margay, which looks more bored out of its senses than happy, but that's captivity for you. (You're almost endangered, buddy...)

Then came the frogs and toads... I only saw one, a poison dart frog.

There was also a day-old calf named Princessa... She was quite playful once she managed to stand.

As we were walking out, there was a Coati enjoying some snacks out of the trashcan. It was oddly friendly, so, naturally, we played around with it a bit. (That's USA tourists for you...)

We then made a stop at a coffee plantation and saw the biggest wasp I ever did see.

Another wasp...

A transparent butterfly...

And that's about it. The Sights of Costa Rica are next!
