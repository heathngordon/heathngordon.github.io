As we move into the winter months, you’ll begin to see less and less songbirds and more and more predators such as owls and hawks. This isn’t because of any type of migration, per se, as most predatory birds don’t migrate, but rather because winter is breeding season. This might seem odd to you, but think about. 

Owls. These are the silent killers that often live in the woods behind you without you knowing. These are the mystical noises that wake you up in the middle of the night. These are the birds with those adorable balls of fluffs with giant eyes for babies. And then they grow up to wrack terror into the minds of those other small creatures that live in your yard. Or maybe you. If you’re my sister. Or Shemar Moore. But as we move into the winter months, you might have noticed that these sage creatures of the forest (thank you, Ruthie) have made themselves much more apparent than they would be at any other time of the year. 

Winter is their mating season. Why the dead of winter, you ask? Well, these birds can grow to stand at least two feet tall (like the Great Horned Owl), with a wingspan of nearly three and half feet (Barred Owl). For the typical songbird, the whole entire nesting cycle takes only a few weeks: from laying the eggs, incubation, hatching, nestling, to fledgling. If you’re not a chipmunk, you know the first part. As soon as all the eggs are laid, one or both of its parents will begin incubating the eggs-keeping them warm until they are fully developed and ready to hatch. This usually takes, depending on the species, somewhere in the neighborhood of 10-20 days (except Killdeer, the type of bird that’s always nesting in the parking lot, take a whopping 30 days). From there, the bird becomes a “nestling”, depending solely on its parents for food and warmth while its feathers grow and its strength continues to develop. Somewhere in between another span of 10-30 days, the young bird decides that it’s going to brave the outside world and starts following the parents around, flapping its wings and begging for food. The parent uses this opportunity to teach it where to find food and to develop other skills such as bird songs and foraging. At the end of that period, the young bird decides on its own that it’s time to exit the nest and usually leaves for good. This whole process for songbirds normally takes about 20 days (unless you’re a Killdeer or a Chimney Swift). For owls, however, it takes nearly two and a half months.

Incubation lasts for 28-33 days, and nestlings take nearly 40 days to develop. You do the math. And for such a big bird, it makes sense. So by the time the eggs are laid, incubated, and the young owl develops, it’s already March. The perfect time for young owls to be hopping around, considering all those little mice are starting to poke their wet noses into a new world. 

The two most common owls we have in the St. Louis area are the Great Horned Owl and the Barred Owl (which we saw at the Retreat). Both of these birds ironically live near my house-I say ironically because the Great Horned and the Barred are sworn enemies in BirdLand- and one of my goals this past summer was to find either one of their nests. Owls usually mate for life, and you figure, if they return to the same nest every day after a good night of hunting, it shouldn’t be that hard to find, right? Wrong. I never did find those nests. And still haven’t. These are big birds. Their territory spans sometimes over two hundred acres, sometimes even half a mile in diameter. They’re not going to be easily found. 

This is why places such as Powder Valley and other nature conservation centers often have what they call “Owl Prowls”, where they’ll take a group of people out one evening, mimicking and listening for owls. As cheesy as they sound, they’re quite enjoyable-with the right crowd, of course. Although, as birders, I’m sure you’re capable of doing this on your own. One of the best ways to find what owls live around your house or even your favorite birding spot is to look on a website called “ebird”, where birders from all around the world record various bird sightings and observations. It’s a great resource to use even to before you go to a new birding spot to see what species you might want to look for, or even afterwards to record the species that you saw.
