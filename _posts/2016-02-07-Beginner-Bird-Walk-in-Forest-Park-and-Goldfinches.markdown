title: Beginner Bird Walk in Forest Park and Goldfinches
---

This week, instead of going to a County/State park, I decided to grab one of my friends and go to a Beginner's Bird Walk in Forest Park, which happens every first Saturday of the month. Needless to say, it was pretty darn cool, and I learned a lot. 

We saw a lot of birds, but I didn't get the chance to capture pictures of a lot of them, because I was too busy peering with amazement through an awesome pair of binoculars that they had lent me.

Honestly, before this, I had sort of understood why birders needed binoculars, but figured that the zoom on my camera was sufficient. But it really is a whole new experience watching a bird through the lenses of a good pair of binoculars and not digitized, on a tiny screen. I mean, sure, one of those can replicate the bird so I can look at it later, but the binoculars just give you a chance to appreciate the bird in all its fine plumage and behavior-something that I think we tend to lose when we use cameras all the time. 

The other thing that this group brought to my attention was just how many birds I have in my backyard, and how many I've started to view as "common" that really, I should relearn how to appreciate. I knew almost every bird on that walk, and could identify it within a heartbeat. We met only two that baffled me: Hooded Mergansers and domesticated Mallards (Mallards interbred with different types of ducks). And yet the group, no matter how experienced, all marveled at things as common as Blue Jays, Cardinals, Red Winged Blackbirds... I could go on. But I hope my point is clear: sometimes it's best we take a step back, sometimes, as birders and realize the simple, bright beauty of a Blue Jay, the tropical plumage of the Cardinal, and the bright patches of a Red Winged Blackbird. We need to remember that sheer thrill of recognizing them for the first time, and appreciate them for the creatures that they are, despite how common. The same thing, I guess, translates to our fellow humans: remember that each human is a work of art. Some of them treat us like they're the only piece of art in the world, but we have an advantage, because we know they're not. We know that we are just one in a million... billion... trillion-however many there are on this planet of ours-and treat them with the grace we give ourselves so often. 

Okay. I apologize for that little tangent. Apparently listening to Sleep music while blogging does some interesting things. 

BUT-back to birds. 

Here's one of the Blue Jays I saw. I was still in my car at this point, but this guy had a lot of personality. He kept flying from the tree branches to this one spot on the ground, where something that interested him was. Honestly just fun to watch him and his tactics.

This is the pair of Hooded Mergansers we saw-another bird species checked off the list! Duck species, to be more precise, but I learned that this is somewhat of a rarity for Forest Park. They were a bit far away-this was where the binoculars were so handy, because I could see them nearly perfectly through them-but my camera was unable to capture anything of use... so I tried to crop them a bit so you could see their markings and such. The female's on the left, male on the right.

Just some Mallards being Mallards...

We hiked around a the lake a bit, spotting Red Winged Blackbirds, Cardinals, Sparrows, and the like... then went up the hill to where one of the leaders, Mark Glenshaw, who watches the Great Horned Owls in Forest Park, pointed out the pair roosting in a weirdly shaped pine tree. (His website is forestparkowls.blogspot.com if any of you are interested.) These owls, affectionately named Olivia and Charles, were probably the coolest thing I saw on this hike. And yes, I got pictures. Bad pictures, but pictures nonetheless.

Olivia is the most prominant of the two, although apparently quite small for a female, and is the one on the left. Charles is more hidden, on the right, but if you look closely, you can see his white chest feathers hidden behind the branches.

Look at that brown. Simply beautiful. (Olivia again.)

I wasn't able to get a good picture of Charles since he was tucked back in that tree so far, but we walked around it and could see him from behind. My friend accurately described him as being like a giant, oversized pinecone. 

But yes... over all, the walk was awesome. I'm going to definitely try to go next month, if I can. 

So, the walk was yesterday, but this morning, I was looking out my window as I took my vitamins, and saw a funny bird that I thought I hadn't seen before. Its head was yellow, but it had a very distinct line of white separating its head from the rest of its back, that white connecting to its throat and chest. Its wings were an oddly familiar patterning of black and white. I was thinking to myself, "An early migrater?" But this bird wasn't new at all. It was, as you probably guessed by the title, a Goldfinch-but in winter plumage.

I haven't seen these guys since October, and to see a whole flock of them suddenly return from the South... that was startling. During the bird walk, one of the guides had noted that the male Red Winged Blackbirds always came first in migration to set up a territory, and then the females always followed. But this year, they said, the males had come very early. Already there were birds gaining their breeding plumage, and it's only February. Theey explained it was probably because of the climate change, but... even with that, it's still cold. 

Granted, these Goldfinches weren't in their breeding plumage. They still wore their winter feathers, and perhaps they're here to stay until those feathers come in. Yet, with all of these birds migrating early, and no flowers or other sources of food growing yet, I'd be startled if most of them survived. But perhaps they will. Birds tend to be resilient in matters of survival, and I'm definitely not an expert yet. But I think this is also a responsibility that we have to take as bird lovers, as well-to keep our feeders full, especially during the winter and spring months, when nature doesn't provide enough food to go around.

Also, keep watching for more unusual migrations like these, and make sure to report them to eBird. They could use the data!
