title: Morning Birding
---

When you get up early enough that the sun has barely risen, the morning dew still covers the ground as thick as a blanket, and best of all, the morning bird song is louder than the cicadas and grasshoppers, then you know that you're up at the best time of day. Where you can settle down in the driveway with your back to a car and just watch. And listen. And nearly be run into by Northern Cardinals and flocks of Eurasian House sparrows. Where it's hardly a challenge to take pictures of the hundreds of birds that fly by and yet still never be able to capture their energy and curiosity in you. THAT is the best time of day.

I realize I haven't posted in a while. I've been busy with getting ready to go back to school, signing up for one last ACT (hooray!), staining decks, and slowly building up my freshwater aquarium. (I got a snail! He's a golden mystery snail. His name is Elodin, after the Name of the Wind series. Also, I bought my betta fish, Eo, a bigger tank. She and Elodin are living there now.) Since my last post, there have been a number of hummingbirds that have visited the feeder. The most curious of which is a black and white mottled hummingbird. My best picture of it is this:

(Screens on windows are evil. They never let you take good pictures.) I've been trying to capture a better picture, but he's fairly timid. 

We had a similar hummingbird at the Wild Bird Rehabilitation, but only some of it was black and white. So maybe it's a sort of molting or juvenile plumage? Or perhaps just a color defect. We'll see if it continues to develop or not. 

Besides that, the Brown Thrashers have returned! I saw one the other day without realizing it, and then another one this morning, poking around our garden with a fellow Cardinal.

Now that the cone flowers are starting to dry up, I see the Goldfinches a little more often, although they're very skittish. When I went outside this  morning, they all flew up with their "pa-chee-chee-chee-chee!" and continued to fly around from tree top to tree top until things settled down and I had been out of sight for a few minutes.

The Cardinals were just as energetic as always, and the Eurasian Tree Sparrows even more so. (As I'm writing this, there's a woodpecker pecking on my roof. It sounds like a Downy or a Hairy. Kind of funny.)

Of course, there were an abundance of Blue Jays crying and squalling, generally making a racket.

Which reminds me... the other day, I walked downstairs and looked at the feeder on the back porch and saw this:

Naturally, I called over my sister to look at it, and she asked, "Is it okay?" I wouldn't have been able to answer if I hadn't volunteered at WBR this summer. So, of course it was alright. Merely sunning its feathers. It flew away in the next few minutes, but it just struck me that I've created a place where birds feel safe enough to sun themselves on the porch. Granted, Blue Jays are a tad more daring and reckless than others, but it's still a nice compliment. 

One last note... if you have any of these types of plants in your yard or near you...

...these are Poke Berries. Toxic to humans, of course, but the birds love them. If you find them before the birds do, try putting a sprig or two by your feeder. They'll create a mess of them, but they'll be thanking you.
