title: Great Crested Flycatcher
---

My friend just texted me a picture of this bird, wanting to know what type it was. And to my great surprise, I realized it was a Great Crested Flycatcher! I've never seen one... but you bet I will by the end of this summer! This is one of the birds on my long list of birds I need to see...
