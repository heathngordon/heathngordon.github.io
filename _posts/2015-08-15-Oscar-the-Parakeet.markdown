title: Oscar the Parakeet
---


It's not everyday that you walk outside with your dog and find a bright green bird enjoying a crabapple in your tree. But that's what happened to me today. This morning, there was a parakeet, not one of those big wild ones, mind you, but one of those that they sell at petstores, sitting in the tree. It was making very strange noises, much like a Monk Parakeet (which I learned about in  my search), which confirmed that I wasn't insane and I actually did see a parakeet. 

After a half an hour of research, I found a missing parakeet report in the news.

(From St. Louis Post Dispatch)

Apparently in July, an unclipped parakeet, Oscar, escaped from the house of his beloved owner, and hasn't been sighted since the second week of July. Although it was a long shot, I emailed the owner and let her know that I had seen him, and that he was still alive and looked healthy. Unfortunately, I haven't seen him since this morning. Hopefully he'll come back, but as we're restaining our deck over the weekend, our bird feeders are down, so attracting him back would be hard. 

Here's to hoping that Oscar enjoyed the crabapples so much that he'll return, and hopefully, eventually to his owner (who will possibly consider clipping his wings or making sure he is securely latched in his cage before she opens the front door).
