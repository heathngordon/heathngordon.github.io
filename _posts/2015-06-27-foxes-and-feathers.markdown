title: Foxes and Feathers
---

When you're out running every evening every day of the week, it's amazing how many birds you see. And for some reason, I've seen more than I have running in the morning, but perhaps it's because in the morning, I don't run in a large forest. 

But this week was a Cross Country Training camp. There were the usual, Cardinals, American Robins, European Starlings, Grackles, and Carolina Wrens, but there were also Barred Owls swooping in front of our path and landing on the branch next to us, Red Tailed Hawks perching above us as we start our warm-up run, and tiny Ruby Throated Hummingbirds at rest on tiny twigs high above. Unfortunately, there are no pictures of this because, well, I was running. But it was still amazing. 

Just to keep up with Revlon and Rachelle's nest (the Mourning Doves' nest), they're still doing fine. No sign of any nestlings, but at least nobody's been eaten yet. (That's what happened to their first two clutches.)

This picture is from today, so all is well. I'll keep y'all updated on the clutch's progress.

Some more pictures from this week:

A Northen Cardinal and a Black Capped Chickadee inspecting the scraps from my neighbor's feeder.

A male and female Northern Cardinal. These two were fledglings just last week. They grow up fast, I guess.

A White Breasted Nuthatch watches the feeder from a distance.

Another of the neighbors makes an appearance for the camera: Chanook! He and his mate had a clutch at the first site of Revlon and Rachelle's nest... but they lost it to some scavaging blue jays. We did get to see the nestlings, but they disappeared one by one a few days after they hatched. The world's a tough place for a bird.

Chanook again, with a seed from the feeder.

Caught this little fellow scavaging under the feeder. I thought he was Tilla for a bit, but... nope. Perhaps a litter-mate, or just her mate? They share the same nest. Guess I'll have to name him if he sticks around...


When I filled up my feeders the other day, I left a little out at the base of the step like I always do for Raymond. But it wasn't Raymond who came to collect it...

...Twas Adamine! She was quite enjoying herself until she noticed me and my camera.

You can tell it's her and not Raymond by the amount of red on her rump.

I've mentioned the foxes before. Well, this afternoon, my brother spotted them having a bit of fun in the backyard. He managed to get a few pictures of them.

Apparently they were hunting, and managed to catch a vole or a mole or something small. He didn't see it well enough to tell.

Cute little beasties.

At some point, they'll get names. Probably from Redwall, because I love those books, and although the foxes in it are always evil, they're usually quite amusing. Unless they're vixens, in which case, they're kind of creepy. Soothsayers and all. (I don't think this pair is into throwing bird bones and sea shells and reading the stars.)

Well... that's it for now. More will come next week.
