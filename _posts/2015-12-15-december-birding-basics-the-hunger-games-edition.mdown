All it takes is one clear, striking note, and even the trees fell silent to listen. At least, that’s what I remember. I remember holding his hand, watching with wide eyes as we walked, listening to the profound stillness and peace that came with my father. But the birds were always the best listeners. To the very end, they stayed perched in their trees, not even a ruffling feather, straining to hear every note that rolled off his tongue. And then, when he was done, when they were sure he was done, the boldest of them would sing that first glimmering note. He would let it hang in the air, crystalize, and suddenly the silence would shatter. The forest would come alive with birdsong, echoing back and forth as each bird took up the melody, added its own voice, and passed it along to its neighbor. The song could last for hours, could be carried for miles, and they would never tire of it. At least, that’s what I remember. 

The mockingjay is a curious bird, one of so many talents and tricks, that to describe it as I usually describe other birds would not do it justice. We’ve talked this year of so many different aspects of the bird, but I think mockingjays top them all. Mockingjays are abundant throughout the whole year, although once a year, new flocks come south from the northern mountains, carrying curious songs that are familiar from District 13. They leave again when the snow begins to melt and the primroses begin to bud, their bright yellow faces seeming to tell the mockingjays that the sun has returned in their home mountains. Flocks and flocks of them pass through, and if you listen hard enough, you can hear them warping the other birds’ songs as they fly. It’s like a game to them, I suppose. Like the game children here have started playing, hitting a sack or ball with a stick and seeing how far they can run before getting tagged with it again. Instead, these birds toss their songs back and forth, changing it as quickly as the wind. It reminds me of the old days, not that they were good days, but they were childhood. At least, at the very least, my father was there, out in the forest. The mockingjays almost counted him as one of their own. I think, for a while, they did. And when he died, their song stopped. They mourned and I didn’t go out to see them again… I’m sorry. I was telling you about the mockingjay. 

I think the most remarkable thing about these birds is yes, their skill for mimicking and warping songs, but also their skill to sing several notes at once. If you listen hard enough, you can hear it: trills going one way, scales going the other way, meeting somewhere in the middle, and bursting forth as a whole new complicated melody. It’s hard to describe, really, if you haven’t heard it yourself, but maybe you could imagine it for a moment. It’s like pure, shining silver against deep coal black: such a mix of beauty and danger and sentiment that it’s nearly incomprehensible. Only, that’s merely what its song sounds like. 

You should know what they look like, so maybe next time you’re out in the forest, you can try to spot one, although they’re more often seen than heard. Just look for a flash of white from the underwings, that’s a mockingjay. They’re mostly grey, with a bit of black, and a noticeable crest on their head. But if nothing else, sometimes, it’s just worth it to just go and listen to the birds. Just sit against a tree and listen. If you’re lucky, maybe they’ll show themselves to you. But even if they’re shy, the least you could do is appreciate their voice. And remember.
