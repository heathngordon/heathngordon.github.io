title: First Goldfinch of the Season!
---

When you're working with birds and people that are obsessed with birds twice a week, you learn a lot. Last Tuesday, when I was there, they had a goldfinch in. I don't remember what was wrong with it, but they told me, "Goldfinches mark the beginning of the migration season." And so here we are! I've spotted the first goldfinch I've seen in my little area... so fall, I guess, has officially arrived in the bird world.

School starts in a few weeks, but I have my Mississippi Flyway list ready, and I'll be noting those and keeping a careful watch for them!

The Goldfinch. I apologize for the fuzziness of the picture. I was taking it through a very dirty window, which I would clean if it weren't on the second floor of a house. 

In other news... there's a fledging Carolina Wren in my garage! I managed to take a few pictures of it, despite the fact that it was freaking out and trying to fly. But every time I go into the garage, all I hear is a constant, "Cheep! Cheep! Cheep!" It's the best.

A parent of the fledgling...


I've also taken to setting out more than just birdseed by the feeder, and have found that my birds love grapes. They take blackberries and blueberries okay, but the grapes are always devoured within half a day. Unfortunately, it's also attracting a lot of blue jays, but that's okay (We need some spunky birds to protect the tiny ones from the large amount of predators around here...) I think I saw an Eastern Bluebird the other day! 

Also, the hummingbird feeder is at last aquiring proper guests (not woodpeckers or ants). Twice yesterday I saw a Ruby Throated Hummingbird! I tried to get a picture of it, but it was too timid to stay very long, so all my pictures are little blurs.

And last, but not least, there was a friendly female Mallard that was very interested in my toe at a park I went to a few days ago. She got pretty close to me, and then decideded that there wasn't anything tasty near me.

Eventually, she went over and joined a few of them that were sleeping on the rocks.

That's all for now!
