This was the view of the mountains and jungles out the window from where we stayed in San Jose.

We passed the National Football (Soccer) Stadium on the way to the camp in Alajuela.

The Cabins we stayed in at the camp. There was no hot water there, and the weather up in the mountains was Colorado-esque, usually in the low sixties or high fifties, plus constant rain for one and half days.

This is guarenteed one of the most beautiful places I'll ever see. It was a tiny little path on the the way to the second waterfall, and it was like walking into a place in a dream or a story. Something you don't find every day. I climbed onto the rock and knelt down to feel the water, which was cold. Not as cold as ice, but still chilly. It made the place feel real.

This is the view from that rock I climbed up on. You can't imagine standing on that outcrop, water droplets plastering your face and camera lens, and the river rushing below you, with the noise of a lion's roar.

Talk about a sizeable drop.

After we finished with the waterfalls, we were driven back up to the top, and back to where we started. We then made our way to our own bus, and back to San Jose. We stopped by a coffee plantation on the way down.

We spent our last night in Costa Rica playing games and remembering the good times of the trip. Well, that's all for now!
