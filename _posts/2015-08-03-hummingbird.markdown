title: Hummingbird

I finally caught a glimpse of the hummingbird enjoying some flowers across the street, and had the opportunity to take some pictures. Unfortunately, he was all the way across the street, and when I tried to get closer, my neighbors came home and scared him off. But these are at least proof he's here.

The rest of the pictures I captured are all fuzzy, so I won't put them up.
