title: Birding Basics: September Edition
---

Along with learning about each bird of the month, we’re also going to get into some birding basics.  This article, because I’m focusing on a migratory bird, we’ll be learning about migration routes.

There are four major migration routes, or “flyways” that birders refer to in North America. At this time of the year, most birds are coming from the north and going south, because of the warmer weather, more food, and the breeding season.  As you can see, St. Louis is located in the Mississippi Flyway. Birds such as American Goldfinches (our bird of the month!), Bald Eagles, Fox Sparrows, and Lapland Longspurs use this flyway. But these birds obviously don’t come all at once, otherwise we’d have a problem on our hands. The skies would be full of birds. They’d probably block out the light of the sun or something. Now you ask, “But some birds don’t migrate, like robins and cardinals. They’re here all year, it seems. Why?” 
	
Some birds, like robins and cardinals, aren’t affected by the cold temperatures nearly as much as others. They’re more durable (as far as the cold goes),  and have more sources of food available that they can consume year-round.

So, now that we’ve gone through that explanation, let’s actually get to the bird of the month, which, as mentioned before, is the American Goldfinch.

This bright, easily recognizable little finch can be found all over the continental United States. The breeding male (as illustrated) is the most striking, with brilliant yellow feathers, black and white wings, and a nifty little cap on his crown. The breeding female, though less striking, has its own softer gold feathers, black eyes bright with energy and cautious curiosity. These are the birds that we see. The juveniles and non-breeding winter adults are what we don’t see. 

American Goldfinches are the first birds that travel the Mississippi Flyway. When a birder sees the first American Goldfinch of their season, then Fall is basically here. They’re attracted especially to dead coneflowers, weedy fields, and plains with plentiful thistles and other seeds. Because of this seed diet, American Goldfinches are among the strictest “vegetarians” among the bird world, only rarely consuming an insect. 

Goldfinches are flocking birds, so if you see one, you’ll see at least three or four more, if not more.  Most often, you’ll hear them before you see them. Their resting song is a long series of warbles and sweet  swee notes. They have a distinctive flight call, per chik o ree, or something to that effect. (Honestly, everyone processes bird sounds differently, so I would recommend looking up the American Goldfinch on allaboutbirds.org and listening to the recorded sounds there.) Well, that’s all I have for now. I recommend exploring audubon.org if this interests you at all. They have some pretty neat stuff.
