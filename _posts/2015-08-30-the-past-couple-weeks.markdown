title: The Past Couple Weeks
---


I started my senior year two weeks ago, and needless to say, it's SO much better than junior year. Besides my thesis that I have to write and present this year, I think it's going to be a breeze. 

BUT-I'm here to write about birds. This year, I'm going to be writing a newspaper article on birds. Every month, I'll focus on a different type of bird. I'll draw them (hopefully with color), and then talk about their characteristics, what they eat, how to attract them, and other information like that. So that should be cool. I'll post them on here once they're published. 

So, these past couple weeks, I've been getting out to my car early and just sitting and watching birds from there, in my driveway. And I've seen the usual goldfinches, cardinals, doves, etc. But it's just been a nice, relaxing time to get to know their behavior a little bit more. For example, one sparrow quite enjoys sitting on the top of a bush and singing as loud as its little vocal chords will allow it. Quite amusing, actually.

Here's the little House Sparrow. Such a happy little fellow.

The Goldfinches around here are getting braver and braver, not to mention, there's a lot more of them now than there was earlier in the migration season. I often see them on these dead and dried cone flowers, or in the street, picking at dropped seeds.

Bright little whippersnappers in the early morning, that's for sure.
