title: The Fox and the Hummingbird

More fox sightings and finally, the first hummingbird sighting in my yard!

We've decided to name the fox pair after the foxes in <i>The Fox and the Hound </i>, so their names are Todd and Vixey. (Disney is so creative, aren't they?) 

They were playing around in the backyard again, although Vixey is pretty shy, so once she saw us, she dived back into the woods. 

However, as we were waiting to see if she would come out, the first hummingbird I've seen in the Backyard this summer appeared, alighted on a branch of a sycamore.

The only hummingbird that lives or comes through the midwest is the Ruby Throated Hummingbird, and this is most definitely an adult male.

I apologize for the low quality of this picture, but I just wanted to show the orange-red throat.

That's all the excitement for now. Off to Costa Rica for the next week!
