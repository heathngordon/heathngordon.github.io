title: Birding in Costa Rica
---

The trip to Costa Rica was awesome! While I wasn't there primarily for birding, I did manage to snap a few pictures of birds. 

In San Jose, I think the coolest bird was the Mitred Parakeet. In my past two years in Costa Rica, I never realized that the large flocks of birds were actually real, wild parakeets. It's like seeing a lion for the first time in a Safari: something that you've seen in cages all your life is suddenly out roaming the wild and able to survive on its own.

Costa Rica's national bird, the Clay Colored Thrush.

Perhaps a Grayish Saltator? It was pretty far away from my window, so I couldn't get a clear look at it.

A White Winged Dove.

A pet rooster. Just because, why not?

A Great Kiskadee. These were all over Costa Rica, especially in San Jose, but also in the Alajuela.

Another shot of him, showing his second black band and the yellow crown.

In the mountains of Alajuela, there were several different birds, including a multitude of hummingbirds, especially at a nature reserve that we vistited.

A Horned Lark, ammophilia, I think. I don't have a better picture mainly because most of the time, my camera was in a locked car for safety reasons.

A Boat Tailed Grackle.

These Tree Swallows were everywhere, swooping up and down, catching any insect that happened to find its way into their mouths. This is one of the few times I saw them at rest.

A Silver-Throated Tanager.

A Black and Yellow Silky Flycatcher.

Perhaps a Melodious Blackbird?

Female Green Crowned Brilliant Hummingbird.

Male Green Crowned Brilliant Hummingbird.

This was the only picture I could snap of the Violet Sabrewing. Like most hummingbirds, they hardly stayed still for more than a second, and when they were still, they were in the dark light of the trees, so putting my camera in AV mode (aperature priority mode), it didn't help much.

This is by far and away the best picture of a hummingbird I got in Costa Rica. It was sitting on this bench, licking up some dropped sugar water, and yet I have absolutely no idea what it is. 

So there's that. I'll attempt to post other pictures of non-birds later.
