Random animal facts? Birds? Stories? Drawing? If there's any of that (especially the birds), then I'm hooked. 

The name's Heather. I enjoy watching birds and taking pictures of them. I love to write stories, explore different hypotheticals, but most of all, read dystopian stories (especially the new *Red Rising* trilogy by Pierce Brown). 

On this blog, you'll find a collection of all my birding pictures (and a few miscellanious others) taken with my Canon PowerShot SX520 HS, a collaboration of my stories (mostly unfinished, unrefined ideas), and some random thoughts my brain.
