  <section class="post-content"><p>It was the first time in a year since I'd seen him. And now they expected us to do an entire mission together.</p>
	<p>Feelings aside, I'm glad it was him, because he's the one that I trusted most during my training. He knew me better than I knew myself. He knew my strengths and he knew my weaknesses. But after we broke up, he couldn't have been more wrong about myself, or that's what I thought.</p>
	<p>Not until after this mission.</p>

	<p>“Miss Bentley!”, Commanding Officer Gordon called.</p> 
	<p>“Yes sir!” I turned from what I was doing and immediately saluted, my left index and pointer fingers together, touching my left eyebrow. </p>
	<p>“At ease. A word, in my office please.” </p>
	<p>“Sir.” I replied and made way to his office. He followed and closed the door behind me.</p>
	<p>I stepped in and looked around, then stopped short. Standing in the corner was the one man that I did not want to be in the same room with. </p>
	<p>He nodded his head toward me. “Faren.” His tone was official, but soft. </p>
	<p>“Reece,” I returned. </p>
	<p>“Ah, glad to see you two getting along again,” Commander Gordon said behind us, the door snapping shut behind him. </p>
	<p>“Sir,” Reece called, snapping to attention. </p>
	<p>“At ease, Brooks.” He sat down at his desk, which was covered in papers and folders to be reviewed. On the corner of his desk stood an empty photo frame. In Laeconia, those in the military were not allowed to have anything personal with them, lest it distract them from their training or their job. And so many of the soldiers took to having an empty photo frame to remind them of their family that awaited them at home, or that had died in combat. </p>
	<p>Gordon pulled out a black folder that had “Laecon 10” stamped in gold on the cover. A mission. We were about to receive a mission. Together.</p>
	<p>Why would they do that? I asked myself, the feeling of dread rising in my stomach. And entire mission with the one person that I shouldn't be around. </p>
	<p>Gordon sat back and began reading out of the black folder. “A week ago, the Irene Rebels moved against us and took over one of our bases in West Laeconia. You will be leading a squad of soldiers to gather information on the status of the base, and the locations of the enemy of the base to prepare to retake it. You will also be transporting prisoners to the base to exchange for any imprisoned Laeconians or information.” He stood up and shut the folder. “The kings are fully aware of  the status of your relationship, and believe that if you are to prove yourself worthy of your next ranks, then you will be able to complete this mission with no complications.”</p>
	<p>He turned to me. “Bentley, you will be the senior leader of this mission. Please choose your two best officers to accompany you.”</p>
	<p>“That would be Koven and Shipp, sir.”</p>
	<p>He nodded. “Accepted.” He turned to Reece. “Brooks, you will be her adviser. Make sure to stay on mission.”
	“Sir.”</p>
	<p>“Good. You will meet your troop in half an hour at the planing station. Do not be late. You leave at eleven hundred. Dismissed.”</p>
	<p>We both threw up last salutes and left the room. I tried to walk away as quickly as I could without making eye contact, but Reece caught my arm. </p>
	<p>“Faren.” I turned, the feeling in my stomach like a dead weight. He looked the same as the night I left him, dark hair pulled back in a small pony-tail, dressed in the Laeconia black with the gold “BROOKS” patch across the left side of his chest. </p>
	<p>“What?” I asked, trying to control my emotions. Trying not to have any emotions at all.</p>
	<p>“Will you be able to do this?” His dark brown eyes looked sincere. I cleared my head. This was not about me. This was about the mission.</p>
	<p>“Yes, Brooks. If they didn't think I had the ranks or experience, they wouldn't have chosen me.”</p>
	<p>“That's not what I--" </p>
	<p>“It's just a simple scouting and prisoner exchange mission, Reece.” I pulled my arm out of his grip and walked away, pushing my thoughts out of my mind. I couldn't afford to be thinking about our relationship. I had a duty to my state, to Laeconia. Not to Reece. That ended a year ago, and it didn't need to be started again. </p>
	<p>I went to inform my officers of the mission, and went back to my quarters to grab my things.</p>2
